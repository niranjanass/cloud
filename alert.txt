HEALTH ALERTS APPLICATION FOR A REGION
Viral and mosquito borne diseases rise seasonally and regionally. Hygiene is one of the
reasons why some regions in India have higher disease rate compared to others. It would
be great if an application could collect data, analyze and report to authorities. Here is a
problem statement for one such application.
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Create a smart phone application that can be used by
individuals as well as various medical clinic authorities in each region to report viral and
mosquito borne cases registered per day. The application interface can be as simple as
type of viral infection reported or optionally collect all the symptoms reported. Location
data can be obtained from smart phone and the data can then be sent to MATLAB
ThingSpeak channel. Using MATLAB, we can analyze the data reported and create
reports that can be sent to regional municipal authorities for necessary actions or posted to
the same app where users can view health alerts for their area.

With the increase in health problem,more and more people are affected by some kind of disease while they are unaware of it.
Viral and mosquito borne diseases rise seasonally and regionally. Hygiene is one of the
reasons why some regions in India have higher disease rate compared to others.
