The app provides a facility for users to login and enter the necessary details.A separate login module is provided for individuals and hospital management respectively.Essential medical reports must be attached while submitting the patient's details.
The data entered by the user is stored in firebase,realtime database in which data is hosted on the cloud and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.
The data stored in firebase is then sent to Thingspeak channel,which is used used to visualise and analyse live data streams in the cloud.Based on analysis,medical reports can be generated and sent to municipality authorities.
